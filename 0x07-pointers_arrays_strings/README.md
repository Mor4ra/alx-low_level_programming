# 0x07. C - Even more pointers, arrays and strings

## Description
This project further advances your understanding of pointers, arrays, and strings. You'll work with multidimensional arrays, memory manipulation functions, and string searching algorithms.

## Learning Objectives
- How to use pointers to pointers
- What are multidimensional arrays and how to use them
- What are the most common C standard library functions to manipulate strings

## Files
- `main.h` - Header file with function prototypes
- `0-memset.c` - Fills memory with a constant byte
- `1-memcpy.c` - Copies memory area
- `2-strchr.c` - Locates a character in a string
- `3-strspn.c` - Gets the length of a prefix substring
- `4-strpbrk.c` - Searches a string for any of a set of bytes
- `5-strstr.c` - Locates a substring
- `7-print_chessboard.c` - Prints a chessboard
- `8-print_diagsums.c` - Prints the sum of the two diagonals of a square matrix

## Key Concepts
- Memory manipulation functions
- String searching algorithms
- 2D arrays and matrix operations
- Pointer arithmetic
- Character set operations

## Compilation
```bash
gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89 *.c -o output
```

## Requirements
- Betty coding style
- No global variables
- No standard library functions unless specified
