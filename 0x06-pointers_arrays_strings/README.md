# 0x06. C - More pointers, arrays and strings

## Description
This project continues exploring pointers, arrays, and strings with more advanced manipulation techniques. You'll implement standard library functions and work with string transformations.

## Learning Objectives
- How to use pointers to pointers
- What are multidimensional arrays and how to use them
- What are the most common C standard library functions to manipulate strings

## Files
- `main.h` - Header file with function prototypes
- `0-strcat.c` - Concatenates two strings
- `1-strncat.c` - Concatenates two strings with n bytes limit
- `2-strncpy.c` - Copies a string with n bytes limit
- `3-strcmp.c` - Compares two strings
- `4-rev_array.c` - Reverses the content of an array of integers
- `5-string_toupper.c` - Changes all lowercase letters to uppercase
- `6-cap_string.c` - Capitalizes all words of a string
- `7-leet.c` - Encodes a string into 1337 (leet speak)

## Key Concepts
- String concatenation and comparison
- Array manipulation
- Character transformation
- Working with limited byte operations

## Compilation
```bash
gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89 *.c -o output
```

## Requirements
- Betty coding style
- No global variables
- No standard library functions unless specified
